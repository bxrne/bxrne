# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Adam!

I'm a passionate [**[ISE]**](https://software-engineering.ie) student with a focus on **Deep Learning** and expertise in **Computer Vision** with Industrial automation and Automotive perception experience on high-level projects. ðŸ’¼ [Portfolio](https://bxrne.com)

**Currently working on:** [relay](https://github.com/ULAS-HiPR/relay) a processing chain for machine learning applications for a satellite as part of the MACH24 competition as part of [ULAS-HiPR](https://github.com/ULAS-HiPR)

I started coding around 10 y.o. and was mainly in the Web Dev space exploring Angular 1 some years later and moving to React and Next.
On my residencies at ISE I have found my niche to be in Computer Vision. I have industry experience working with in-house models, custom training strategies and integrating new runtime supports into service architecture for an embedded edge deployed NVIDIA ecosystem.

## ðŸ”§ Tooling

Many of my projects now centre around these technologies. I have experience developing my own tooling for training and dataset management.
