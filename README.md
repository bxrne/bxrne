# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Adam Byrne!

I'm a passionate **Immersive Software Engineering** student with a focus on **Deep Learning** and expertise in **Computer Vision**. 
ðŸ’¼ Check out what I am up to at [bxrne.com](https://bxrne.com).

I started coding around 10 y.o. and was mainly in the Web Dev space exploring Angular 1 some years later and moving to React and Next.js
On my residencies at ISE I have found my niche to be in Computer Vision. I have industry experience working with in-house models, custom training strategies and integrating new runtime supports into service architecture for an embedded edge deployed NVIDIA ecosystem.

## ðŸ”§ Tooling

Many of my projects now centre around these technologies. I have experience developing my own tooling for training and dataset management.
